# ðŸ¤– Karl

Karl will be the brain of a little robot friend. The inspiration came from watching the following YouTube video. While the hardware in the video is pretty retro-awesome, I think it would be a smart move to leave any Alexa/Siri/... assistants behind as the core brain, but instead leverage some of the recent AI models to power Karls brain.

### Step 1: Whisper

The first step will be to implement speech-to-text capability for Karl. For that we run a high-bandwidth speech recognition model called "Whisper", open-sourced by OpenAI, locally.

### Step 2: Dream

There seems to be a high-bandwidth alternative to ChatGPT, called https://gpt4all.io/index.html We'll look into that, if that can be fed the transscibed text from Whisper to process the response.
